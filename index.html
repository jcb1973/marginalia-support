        <h2>About Marginalia</h2>
        <p>
            Marginalia is a private reading notebook designed for readers who want a structured way to track books,
            organise tags, and capture notes and quotes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app does not use accounts, does not include social features, and does not require a subscription.
            Your data remains on your device unless you choose to export it.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <h3>Adding a book</h3>
        <p>
            Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the centre of the tab bar. You have three options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scan a barcode</strong> &ndash; point your camera at the ISBN barcode on the back of a book. The title, author, cover image, and other details are filled in automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Type an ISBN</strong> &ndash; enter the 10- or 13-digit ISBN number and tap <em>Lookup</em> to fetch book details.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual entry</strong> &ndash; type in the title, author, and any other details yourself. No ISBN required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tracking your reading</h3>
        <p>
            Each book has a reading status: <em>To Read</em>, <em>Reading</em>, or <em>Read</em>.
            Change the status from the book detail screen. The Home screen shows your currently reading books
            and a summary of your library at a glance.
        </p>

        <h3>Notes and quotes</h3>
        <p>
            Open any book and use the <em>Quotes</em> and <em>Notes</em> tabs to save passages and thoughts.
            For quotes, you can photograph a page and Marginalia will extract the text using on-device OCR &ndash;
            no data leaves your device. You can also add a page number and a personal comment to each quote.
        </p>

        <h3>Tags and organisation</h3>
        <p>
            Create tags (e.g. "Fiction", "Work", "Favourites") and assign them to books.
            In the Library, filter by one or more tags. You can switch between matching
            <em>any</em> selected tag or requiring <em>all</em> selected tags.
        </p>

        <h3>Star ratings</h3>
        <p>
            Rate books from 1 to 5 stars on the book detail screen. Use the Library filter to find books by rating.
        </p>

        <h3>Search, sort, and filter</h3>
        <p>
            The Library screen has full-text search across titles and authors, sorting options (title, date added,
            rating), and filters by reading status, rating, and tags. The All Quotes and All Notes screens
            also support search and date sorting.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Tap the <strong>&hellip;</strong> menu on the Home screen and choose <em>Export (CSV)</em>.
            This creates a CSV file containing your full library, notes, and quotes that you can
            share, save, or open in any spreadsheet app.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I import books?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes. Use <em>Import (CSV)</em> from the same menu. The CSV should follow the same format
            as the export file.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the app require an internet connection?</h3>
        <p>
            Only for ISBN lookup (fetching book details from an online database) and loading cover images
            from URLs. Everything else &ndash; notes, quotes, tags, ratings, and reading status &ndash;
            works entirely offline.
        </p>

        <h3>How does the camera quote capture work?</h3>
        <p>
            When adding a quote, tap <em>Photograph Page</em> to take a photo of a book page.
            Marginalia uses Apple's on-device text recognition (Live Text) to extract the words.
            The text is processed entirely on your device &ndash; nothing is sent to a server.
            You can then edit the extracted text before saving.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if I delete the app?</h3>
        <p>
            All data is stored locally on your device. If you delete Marginalia, your library, notes,
            and quotes will be permanently removed. We recommend exporting your data first if you
            want to keep a backup.

        <h2>Data & Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Marginalia does not require an account and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data
            on external servers.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All reading data is stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li>ISBN lookups use the Open Library API. Only the ISBN number is sent; no personal information is included.</li>
            <li>Camera access is used solely for barcode scanning and page photography. Images are processed on-device and are not uploaded anywhere.</li>
            <li>No analytics, tracking, or advertising SDKs are included in the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You may export your data at any time using the CSV export feature.

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

        <h3>ISBN scan is not recognising the barcode</h3>
        <p>
            Make sure you are scanning the ISBN barcode (usually on the back cover, near the bottom).
            Hold the camera steady and ensure the barcode is well-lit. You can also type the ISBN
            manually and tap <em>Lookup</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Book details did not fill in after scanning</h3>
        <p>
            Some older or niche books may not be in the online database. If the lookup returns no results,
            you can enter the details manually on the same form.
        </p>

        <h3>Quote text extraction is inaccurate</h3>
        <p>
            On-device OCR works best with clearly printed text on a flat, well-lit page. Handwritten text,
            unusual fonts, or curved pages may reduce accuracy. You can always edit the extracted text
            before saving.
